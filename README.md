This is a collection of Prototype Oriented Programming libraries for
Lua 5.1 (including LuaJIT), 5.2 and 5.3. The libraries are copyright by
their authors 2000-2016 (see the [AUTHORS][] file for details), and
released under the [MIT license][mit] (the same license as Lua itself).
There is no warranty.

_prototype_ has no run-time prerequisites beyond a standard Lua system,
though it will take advantage of [stdlib][], [strict][] and [typecheck][]
if they are installed.

Installation
------------

The simplest and best way to install prototype is with [LuaRocks][]. To
install the latest release (recommended):

```bash
    luarocks install prototype
```

To install current git master (for testing, before submitting a bug
report for example):

```bash
    luarocks install http://raw.githubusercontent.com/lua-stdlib/prototype/master/prototype-git-1.rockspec
```

The best way to install without [LuaRocks][] is to copy the `prototype`
folder and its contents into a directory on your package search path.

Bug reports and code contributions
----------------------------------

These libraries are written and maintained by their users.

Please make bug reports and suggestions as [GitHub Issues][issues].
Pull requests are especially appreciated.

But first, please check that your issue has not already been reported by
someone else, and that it is not already fixed by [master][github] in
preparation for the next release (see Installation section above for how
to temporarily install master with [LuaRocks][]).

There is no strict coding style, but please bear in mind the following
points when proposing changes:

0. Follow existing code. There are a lot of useful patterns and avoided
   traps there.

1. 2-character indentation using SPACES in Lua sources.
